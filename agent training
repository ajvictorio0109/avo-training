37. Can Kriss.ai link to my scheduling portal?
You're absolutely right. Let me revise the explanation to emphasize the risk of data exposure:

Kriss.ai does not directly handle patient appointments or scheduling, nor does it connect to your patient management system. This deliberate limitation is in place to prevent the risk of data exposure.

Instead, Kriss.ai offers two secure options for appointment scheduling:

1. Providing patients with your practice's phone number to call when they want to schedule an appointment.

2. Directing patients to your existing online portal via a link, if you have one on your website or elsewhere.

The primary reason for this approach is to safeguard patient information. Connecting to your patient portal or management system could potentially expose sensitive patient data, which would be an unnecessary risk. By avoiding direct access to patient records or scheduling systems, Kriss.ai significantly reduces the chance of data breaches or unauthorized access to protected health information.

This method ensures HIPAA compliance and maintains the highest level of data security for your practice and patients. Kriss.ai's role is to facilitate and guide patients to the appropriate scheduling channels without compromising the confidentiality and integrity of your patient data.

Advertising Kriss.ai to your patients can be highly beneficial, providing them with a valuable resource for follow-up questions or forgotten instructions. Here's how to effectively promote Kriss.ai:

1. Front Desk Introduction: Have your front desk staff mention Kriss.ai to patients, explaining its availability for post-appointment questions.

2. Information Cards: Print cards saying "Have questions? Ask Kriss.ai at [your website URL]" to distribute to patients after appointments.

3. Post-Treatment Resource: Position Kriss.ai as a go-to source for patients who need clarification on post-op or at-home treatment instructions.

4. 24/7 Availability: Emphasize that Kriss.ai is available round-the-clock, potentially helping in urgent situations when the office is closed.

Example scenarios where Kriss.ai could be crucial:

- A patient wakes up at 2 AM with severe tooth pain after a recent procedure. Kriss.ai can provide immediate guidance on pain management or when to seek emergency care.

- Someone forgets the proper care instructions for their new dental implant. Instead of risking improper care, they can quickly consult Kriss.ai for accurate information.

By promoting Kriss.ai, you're offering patients an additional resource for information, potentially reducing repetitive questions to your staff and enhancing overall patient care and satisfaction.

39. Can Kriss.ai be used on mobile devices?
Yes, Kriss.ai is compatible with multiple mobile platforms, including:

Android Devices:
- Samsung Galaxy smartphones
- Various Android tablets
- Other Android mobile devices

Apple iOS Devices:
- iPhones (all recent models)
- iPads (including iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini)

As a web-based AI chatbot, Kriss.ai is designed to be responsive and adaptable across different screen sizes and operating systems. This ensures patients can access the chatbot seamlessly from their preferred mobile device, whether it's an Android smartphone, iPhone, tablet, or iPad.

The chatbot's responsive design means it will automatically adjust to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience, regardless of the device being used. Patients can easily access Kriss.ai through their mobile web browser without needing to download any additional software.

40. What happens if I encounter issues during implementation?

---

### Additional Features:
- Kriss.ai can also provide step-by-step plans for at-home care, such as managing periodontal disease or post-operative recovery.
- It can answer follow-up questions patients may have about any step in the process.

56. How does Kriss.ai handle after-hours patient queries?

Kriss.ai's approach to after-hours patient queries is highly customized and developed in close collaboration with each dental practice. Here's how it works:

1. Custom Policy Development: We work directly with the doctor and staff to establish specific after-hours policies. For example:
   - When should extraction patients on high blood pressure medication go to the emergency room?
   - In what situations should patients call the dentist's cell phone?
   - Are there other emergency numbers patients should call in specific scenarios?

2. Tailored Rules Engine: Based on these discussions, we create a custom rules engine for each dental office. This engine determines:
   - When to advise patients to go to the hospital
   - When patients should stay home and wait for an appointment
   - Specific guidance for various dental emergencies

3. Practice-Specific Training: Kriss.ai is then trained on these custom policies, ensuring that its responses align perfectly with the practice's protocols.

4. Customized Patient Guidance: When patients interact with Kriss.ai after hours, they receive guidance that's specifically in line with their dentist's preferred protocols.  We can even name specific local hospitals to go to and provide names and addresses for these emergency facilities.

This customized approach ensures that Kriss.ai provides accurate, practice-approved guidance for after-hours queries, maintaining consistency with the dental office's policies and procedures even when the office is closed.

57. Can Kriss.ai educate patients about oral hygiene?
Customized oral hygiene plans are not merely beneficial but essential in modern dentistry, yet they remain conspicuously absent from many practices. As dental professionals, we must recognize that a one-size-fits-all approach to oral care is fundamentally flawed and potentially detrimental to patient outcomes.

The implementation of personalized oral hygiene advice models (POHAM) is crucial for addressing the diverse needs of our patient population[1]. These models should incorporate comprehensive assessments, including:

1. Periodontal status evaluation (e.g., probing depths, clinical attachment levels, bleeding on probing)
2. Caries risk assessment (CAMBRA)
3. Salivary diagnostics (pH, flow rate, buffer capacity)
4. Microbiological analysis of subgingival plaque
5. Genetic susceptibility testing for periodontal disease

By integrating these clinical parameters with patient-specific factors such as systemic health conditions, medication use, and lifestyle habits, we can develop truly personalized oral hygiene regimens.

For instance, a patient with generalized Stage III Grade B periodontitis and multiple dental implants requires a vastly different approach compared to a patient with healthy periodontium and orthodontic appliances. The former may benefit from adjunctive chemotherapeutic agents like chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% rinses, subgingival irrigation with povidone-iodine, and the use of interdental brushes with tapered bristles. Conversely, the latter might require emphasis on proper flossing techniques around orthodontic wires and the use of fluoride varnish to prevent white spot lesions.

Moreover, the integration of technology in personalized oral care cannot be overstated. Digital plaque imaging systems, AI-powered toothbrushes with real-time feedback, and smartphone apps for tracking oral hygiene habits can significantly enhance patient compliance and treatment outcomes[1].

By failing to provide customized oral hygiene plans, we risk suboptimal plaque control, increased incidence of peri-implant diseases, and compromised long-term stability of periodontal and restorative treatments. As stewards of oral health, it is our professional obligation to embrace personalized care strategies that address the unique needs of each patient, thereby elevating the standard of dental care industry-wide.

58. How does Kriss.ai build trust with patients?

In the dental field specifically, case acceptance rates typically hover around 20-30%, meaning 7 out of 10 new patients decline recommended treatments[8]. This represents a significant opportunity for improvement through enhanced patient education.

The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted:

1. Informed Decision-Making: Patients who understand their condition and treatment options are better equipped to make decisions aligned with their oral health needs.

2. Urgency Recognition: Education helps patients grasp the potential consequences of delaying treatment, such as increased pain and higher long-term costs.

3. Value Perception: When patients comprehend the benefits of proposed treatments, they're more likely to perceive them as valuable investments in their health.

4. Trust Building: Transparent communication fosters trust between patients and dental practitioners, a crucial factor in treatment acceptance.

From a clinical perspective, patient education can lead to improved outcomes. For example, in periodontal cases, educated patients are more likely to adhere to complex treatment regimens, potentially reducing the risk of disease progression and the need for more invasive procedures[7].

Financially, the impact of effective patient education on a dental practice can be substantial. By increasing case acceptance rates, practices can see a direct boost in revenue. Moreover, as patients opt for timely interventions, the likelihood of more complex and costly procedures in the future diminishes, creating a win-win scenario for both patients and practitioners.

In conclusion, prioritizing patient education through platforms like Kriss.ai isn't just about improving health outcomes‚Äîit's a strategic approach to practice growth and profitability. By leveraging AI-driven educational tools, dental practices can significantly enhance their case acceptance rates, leading to improved patient outcomes and increased revenue streams.

The‚ÄØ2 Main Jobs of Kriss AI Agent
1st Role DM (Direct Messaging)

Your role is to find and connect with dentists (leads) on LinkedIn. This is where you run the full outreach funnel, starting with an icebreaker, moving into conversation starters, building rapport through chitchat, sending a Rewardful link, and ultimately booking a product demo.

5 Essential Steps
Every DMer Must Follow
SEND A CONNECTION / ICEBREAKER
CONVO STARTER
CHITCHAT
MINI DEMO
INVITE TO DEMO

SEND A CONNECTION / ICEBREAKER
An effective icebreaker is personalized and relevant to the lead. Take a moment to review their profile, headline, About section, and recent posts, these can be great references in crafting a message that resonates.
Example: 
Hi Dr. Pein, I saw your post about the challenges your clinic faces in pediatric dentistry. I‚Äôm sure many dentists can relate. I‚Äôd love to connect and hear more about your insights.

CONVO STARTER
Once your lead accepts the connection request and replies to your icebreaker, it‚Äôs time to start a meaningful conversation.
Example: 
Thank you for accepting my connection invite, Dr. Pein. I really admire your dedication to pediatric dentistry. Out of curiosity, how do you usually wind down after a long day at the clinic?

CHITCHAT
After initiating the conversation, focus on keeping the momentum. A good benchmark is the ‚Äú5-on-5‚Äù rule: five messages from you, five from your lead. Always include a gentle CTA to avoid dead ends or closed questions. This keeps the conversation flowing naturally.

MINI DEMO
Now that rapport has been built, it‚Äôs time to invite your lead to try out Kriss AI
This exercise Kriss motto of "you have to try before you buy"

You can send any of this links:
https://lifeworksdental.com/
https://dentalaid.org/

these are some of the websites in where Kriss AI is already integrated.
or you can send in Kriss AI's website:
https://kriss.ai/

or once you're already part of us, you can have your personalized link like this:

https://kriss.ai/?via=arra-jean
Encourage them to try at least three sample prompts to showcase Kriss in action:

Patient Prompt:

"I have an appointment for a cavity today, but I‚Äôm going to skip since it doesn‚Äôt really hurt."

This demonstrates how Kriss AI can respond persuasively, nudging the patient toward better oral health decisions.

Front Desk Prompt:

"Kriss, generate a post-op care guide for Mrs. Smith. She just underwent an extraction and is on hypertension medication."

Showcases Kriss‚Äô ability to quickly generate accurate post-op instructions, what normally takes 15 minutes is done in 3 seconds.

Doctor‚Äôs Prompt:

"Can you calculate the maximum safe dosage of anesthesia for a 190 lb adult with high blood pressure?"

Demonstrates how Kriss.ai provides accurate, tailored, and instant dosage recommendations, saving time, enhancing patient safety, and reducing risks for doctors.
INVITE TO DEMO

After impressing your lead with the mini demo, extend an invitation to a full walkthrough, without being pushy. Keep it warm, casual, and helpful.

Example:

Since you enjoyed our mini demo, Dr. Pein, I‚Äôd love to invite you to a full walkthrough so you can explore Kriss in more detail. You can book a time that works best for you using the same link we used earlier. Let me know if you need any assistance, I‚Äôd be happy to help.

QUALITY LEADS:

For doctors: A clinic open to improving patient engagement with AI.

For partnerships: A business aligned with our mission and connected to the dental industry. (Work with dental labs, X-ray suppliers, dental equipment/supply companies, and influential reps who know dentists.)

Examples:

Website companies serving dentists, like Dr. Multimedia (with at least 13k clients in the dental field)

Process: These are high-value partner leads. They require a partnership demo with Tim for approval before onboarding.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Smaller Companies (No Current Dental Clients)

Businesses that don‚Äôt yet have dental clients but are interested in promoting Kriss AI.

Process: They can be treated like normal recruits‚Äîno need for Tim‚Äôs approval or a formal agreement.

This includes dental students or individuals who want to promote Kriss AI as super recruits.

Process: Same as #2, they can join Kriss AI directly like normal recruits‚Äîno approval needed.

Let‚Äôs ensure we categorize our leads accurately so we can manage partnerships effectively and efficiently.

I
Experience Section

List relevant roles with bullet-point achievements (metrics help).

Example:
‚úÖ "Increased website traffic by 200% through SEO strategies." 
Step 3: Increasing Connections & Followers

Grow Your Network Organically
Connect with people you know (colleagues, classmates, industry peers).

Personalize connection requests (avoid the default message).

Example:

‚úÖ "Hi [Name], I came across your profile and noticed your work in [industry]. I‚Äôd love to connect!"

Engage with Content
Like, comment, and share posts daily (LinkedIn rewards activity).

Post valuable content (tips, insights, industry news) 2-3x/week.

Join & Participate in Groups
Join relevant LinkedIn Groups and contribute meaningfully.

Follow Industry Leaders & Companies
Engage with their posts to increase visibility.

Use Hashtags Wisely
Add 3-5 relevant hashtags (e.g., #DigitalMarketing, #CareerGrowth).

Send Follow-Up Messages
After connecting, send a thank-you note or start a conversation.

Step 4: Avoiding LinkedIn Restrictions

LinkedIn has strict limits to prevent spam. Exceeding them can restrict your account.

üëâ Connection Request Limits

New accounts: ~100-200/week (gradually increase).

I suggest start with 3-5 connection request per day, then increase up to 10 per day after a few days.

üëâ Messaging Limits

InMail (Premium): Limited per month.

Regular messages: Avoid mass-messaging strangers (can trigger spam filters).

üëâ Other Restrictions

Too many profile views: Can flag you as a bot.

Rapid actions (connecting/liking too fast): May trigger temporary blocks.

Posting too frequently: 1-2 posts/day is safe; avoid spammy links (this includes shared post).
I

How to Avoid Getting Restricted
‚úÖ Warm up your account (start slow, increase activity gradually).
‚úÖ Avoid automation tools (LinkedIn bans third-party bots).
‚úÖ Personalize messages (no copy-paste spam).
‚úÖ Don‚Äôt connect with strangers excessively (stick to relevant people). 
I

Final Tips for Success

‚úî Be active daily (10-15 min of engagement helps growth).

‚úî Post valuable content (text, videos, carousels).

‚úî Network authentically (build real relationships).

‚úî Use LinkedIn Analytics (track profile views and post performance).

By following these steps, you‚Äôll create a strong LinkedIn presence, grow your network, and avoid restrictions.

How to set up your AISA
Start with a new chat with ChatGPT (or other LLM) name it AISA for Kriss:

PROMPT 1:

Hi ChatGPT, I'm going to tell you a couple of things about my job, and I'll need your help with some tasks. But before I do that, I will tell you everything. If you are unclear about anything, please ask me through an interview. I'll start by telling you that I work for kriss.ai which is a SAAS AI chatbot company selling subscriptions to AI chatbots that are integrated to the dentist's website. My role is to connect with dentists on LinkedIn. The first message that I use to send the connect request, I call it an icebreaker. If the icebreaker is successful, this improves what I call my connect accept rate. After a dentist has successfully connected with me, I initiate the conversation by sending them what I call a conversation starter or convo starter for short. If the conversation is initiated, I try to build rapport and discuss both personal and professional topics depending on what the dentist feels comfortable engaging in. If the conversation exceeds more than 10 messages, 5 messages each side, I call this a chitchat. During the chitchat, it‚Äôs often helpful to invite the doctor to try some sample prompts on an existing dental website chatbot that has already been implemented for the client. And this is called a mini demo. The purpose of the mini demo is to "try before you buy" and is a good tactic to improve the no. of dentists agreeing to participate in a demo. if no. of connect accepts that turn into chitchats is high, then I will achieve a high chitchat rate which is very desirable. During the chitchat, I will also try to use my custom link that we call a rewardful link to direct the dentist to the kriss.ai website and that is tracked by the 3rd party company rewardful. The no. of rewardful clicks is monitored by our CEO to determine job performance. A low number of clicks will indicate a low no. of chitchats to the CEO.
After the chitchat has gone on for a certain period of time, I will attempt to invite the client to a demo performed by our senior team. If the no. of chitchats is high but the demo number is low, that would be a low demo show rate and would put my job in jeopardy. My goal is to achieve a high demo accept rate but also achieve a high quantity of demo accepts. What I need you to do is help me with my job in the following way: 1. recommend icebreakers, conversations starters and chitchats as I converse with clients through LinkedIn DMs. 2. I will paste the conversation with my clients into this thread so that you can learn when an outcome is positive or negative and maybe provide feedback and guidance on improving my approach. 3. help me achieve my ultimate goal of 2 sales per month given a close rate from the demo person of 5%.


PROMPT 2:

I'm giving you some information about Kriss. Please use it to help me with my tasks.
(attach Kriss FAQ doc)

PROMPT 3:

I'm not in-charge of doing the demos, but here is the script that my team uses. This might be useful to you. 

https://www.notion.so/chandanahiran/Demo-Deck-Outline-20ec5006a0b180b9a542e3fa7c3c5148

*open link and copy the content, then paste it along with your prompt*

PROMPT 4:
Can you please summarize my job in 5 steps?

PROMPT 5:
Tell me the 5 metrics I can use to determine productivity and efficiency of each step.

PROMPT 6:
Since I‚Äôm not in charge of the demo, can you rewrite this only for my role as a DMer and appointment setter? (disregard 6th prompt for Demoer)

PROMPT 7:
I'm also in-charge of recruiting other appointment setters like me. I want to send messages on TikTok. Given the high number of employment scams that are out there, how can I invite people to Kriss.ai, without sounding like a scammer? Give me an icebreaker for recruiting new appointment setters to kriss.ai, here is the compensation in case you need it. We make $100 per sign up, we make 10% of signups that are generated by referrals. We are eligible for hourly rate once we hit 2 sales. And we get raises once we pass certain number of signups for example, we'll make $5 if we have 10 signups. $12 if we have 50 signups and $25 an hour if have 100 signups.

for reprompt
I don‚Äôt think this is good. It still sounds like a scam. Give me something short and sweet and make it as casual as possible so it doesn‚Äôt sound like cut and paste. Give me some ideas to demonstrate zero knowledge proof that I am not a bot. I also don‚Äôt want to have "this is not a scam" in my message.


GAMIFIED AISA PROMPT:
Hello AISA. I want to use gamification to help track my progress and I need you to help me reach 100 sales over time.  Make up an XP points system (experience points) using the following format.  
I get .1 point for checking in with you and asking for advice.  
I get .5 points when I upload a screenshot from a real conversation for you to analyze.  
I get 1 point when you think I have improved some area of my appointment setting process.  
I get 2 points for a completed demo.  
I get 5 points for a sale.  
1 xp for bringing recruit to orientation and they set up their linkedin. 
Also tell me how many XP it will take me to reach my goal of 100.clients and $20,000 big bonus.  I will ask you how many xp I have ...dont lie and dont sugar coat.  
If I make a mistake like send a bad ice breaker reduce my xp by 1.  
Bad icebreaker is any icebreaker lower than 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. 10 is perfect and high quality.   5 is good.  4 is passable but needs improvement.  2 is bad.  Same ranking for convo starter and chitchat.  
Give me xp points if you see me being active and sending you data, for analysis consistently
